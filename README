Install Python 2.4 or higher, the minimum version required by Django. I used Python 2.7 to develop this app.

Install Django 1.3. I used Django 1.2.3 to develop, but haven't found any problems with using 1.3, the latest stable version.
* http://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.3/tarball/
* Extract Django-1.3.tar.gz and cd into that directory.
* python setup.py install

Extract getty.zip wherever you'd like, such as ~/getty. You'll need to edit, run, or at least know of these files:
* getty/manage.py
* getty/settings.py
* getty/twickr.db

Edit settings.py to update the path for the SQLite DB to wherever you extracted the app. Point to the correct absolute path for the file twickr.db.

Configure a Flickr API key in settings.py. If you don't already have one, get one at: http://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply

Run the Django development server:
* python manage.py runserver
* point browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000
* If flickrapi isn't installed properly, you'll get an ImportError in the browser.
* If you get an OperationalError (unable to open database file), check the path of the SQLite DB in settings.py.

The (rather slick) Django admin interface is available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin if you'd like an easy way to look at the DB contents.
* username: admin password: admin

The SQLite database can be reset if desired:
* python manage.py flush

Unit tests can be run:
* python manage.py test twickr
